# RoadMapper
End-of-Bachelor Project in Object-Oriented Programming <br /><br />

This repo declares two classes: <br />

**City** : This class (City) works as a blueprint to create cities (objects) in a network (similar to nodes in graph theory)<br />
**Road** : This class (Road) works as a blueprint to create roads (objects) in a network (similar to edges in graph theory)

City's methods :

- `addRoad(road)`
- `allPossiblePaths(destination, toCreateRoutes)`
- `getName()`
- `getRoads()`
- `getRoutesTo(destination)`

Road's methods :

- `getLength()`
- `getCities()`
- `getRoadsMap(set_of_cities) (static function)`


This project also leverages defensive programming.<br />
